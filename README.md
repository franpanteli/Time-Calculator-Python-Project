# Time-Calculator-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the twelfth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Time-Calculator.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Time-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Time-Calculator.py)), which contained a time calculator function (`add_time`). This took an inputted time (e.g 8:00am) and a quantity of time (e.g 30 minutes) and returned the prior incremented by the latter (e.g 8:30am). A third optional argument was included as part of this, which was for the date of the week of the inputted time. The output time of the function in this case was formatted to include this weekday. Multiple if blocks were constructed when writing this, for the case that the function inputs took different forms. AM/PM functionality was also implemented for the times that the function took. The requirements for this were exported as a PDF from the project UI and annotated with [in-depth problem solving approaches](https://github.com/franpanteli/Time-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf). These were written into Python in the project [Time-Calculator.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Time-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Time-Calculator.py) file, which was submitted to mark the successful completion of the twelfth project in the certification.
